# Wrapping-up

## Clearance

❥ _One person go the **feedback issue** on Kelda created for this workshop and write down the feedback given by the rest of the group._

Three simple questions:

1. What didn't work for you during this workshop? If so what do you to propose?
2. What did work for you and/or what did you like about the workshop? 
3. With which feeling will you leave the workshop?

❥ _If something is already said you don't have to repeat, expect compliments ;-) Only 1. and 2. need to be written down in the issue_

## Thank you!

Happy Open Sourcing! And don't forget your belongings.
