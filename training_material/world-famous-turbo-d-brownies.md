## Recipe

### Preparation time

less than 30 mins

### Cooking time

10 to 30 mins

### Serves

Makes 8-10

### Ingredients

- 100g  unsalted butter
- 150g  soft light brown sugar
- 50g plain flour
- 50g cocoa powder
- ¼ teaspoon of sea salt flakes
- 1 large free-range egg
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 50g walnut pieces (or a mixture of other nuts)

### Method

Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3.

Warm the butter and sugar in a small, heavy-based saucepan, stirring occasionally until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat.

Mix together the flour, cocoa and salt in a bowl, then beat into the melted butter with a wooden spoon until smooth.

In a small bowl, whisk the egg with the vanilla then stir into the pan, ensuring everything is well combined. Fold in the nuts. Pour and scrape the batter into the tin. Bake for 15–20 minutes, until it is beginning to come away at the sides and the top has dried a little just around the edges.

Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool – but not completely. Leave them for 20–30 minutes.
