# Open Source Vision

## Venture Name, Purpose and Tech generator

We are a (fictional) start-up in stealth mode and we want to create an open-source (business) strategy.

We invented a technology (_FutureWeb_) which will revolutionize the web and is the next big thing after web3. 

Our goal today is to research and develop an open-source strategy before we publicly launch our service.

❥ _Create groups of max 3 people._
